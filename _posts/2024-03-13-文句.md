Our seriously shitty cognitive functions feel that when a large number of
letters are there, somehow even the information is there, and they find value
in it on their own. That's why designers in the world go to the trouble of
writing in English what they wrote in Japanese, or suddenly start using
French, or Chinese, Korean, or even Cyrillic as meaningless motifs. Well,
actually, we think, "What a cool !!!!!!" with that. We think, "What a cool ".
Even if there is not a single byte of information there. I've been
disappointed many times when I read it and find it doesn't make any sense at
all. I think that's good. I think that's good. Because we can't help it, we
have an illusion of value. When you get right down to it, architectural styles
(Art Nouveau, Rococo, Gothic, etc.) are completely an extension of such
things. It's just decoration! That's fine, but, hey, if you're going to put
some kind of text there, you might as well do something about it. I know it's
your job, but ...... something, it's sad. I think it's sad, I don't know.
